        <p>
            Before we sign a contract or write a line of code, our team will 
            spend the necessary time needed to understand your product vision.<br>
            The outcome of this scoping session is proposal or high level statement 
            of work.<br> Based on your requirements we can provide a complete offering
            or just the pieces you need.<br>
